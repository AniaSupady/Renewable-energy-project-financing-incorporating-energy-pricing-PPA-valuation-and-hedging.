## **Overview**

### **Key Features**
1. **Mark-to-Market (MtM) Calculation**:
   - Computes daily MtM values for a portfolio of energy commodities (oil, gas, renewables).
   - Provides real-time valuation for risk management.

2. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Net Present Value (NPV)**:
   - Calculates DCF based on projected cash flows and a discount rate.
   - Computes NPV to determine the economic viability of the project.

3. **Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) Valuation**:
   - Assesses the value of fixed-price contracts compared to market prices.
   - Helps forecast revenue streams for renewable energy projects.

4. **Interest Rate Swap Valuation**:
   - Simulates fixed vs. floating interest rate payments for hedging interest rate risks.
   - Enhances financial stability in project financing.

5. **Energy Derivative Valuation**:
   - Models forward contracts to hedge against energy price fluctuations.
   - Reduces exposure to volatile market conditions.

6. **Monte Carlo Simulation**:
   - Accounts for uncertainty in energy prices, production, and interest rates.
   - Provides distributions of key metrics like NPV, PPA value, and swap value.

7. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Evaluates how changes in production levels impact NPV.
   - Offers insights into critical factors affecting project performance.

8. **Visualization**:
   - Plots distributions of NPV, PPA value, swap value, and derivative value.
   - Includes sensitivity analysis graphs for better understanding of risks.
